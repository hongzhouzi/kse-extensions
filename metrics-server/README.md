# Kubernetes Metrics Server

Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes
built-in autoscaling pipelines.

Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through [Metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics)
for use by [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/). Metrics API can also be accessed by `kubectl top`,
making it easier to debug autoscaling pipelines.

Metrics Server is not meant for non-autoscaling purposes. For example, don't use it to forward metrics to monitoring solutions, or as a source of monitoring solution metrics. In such cases please collect metrics from Kubelet `/metrics/resource` endpoint directly.

Metrics Server offers:

- A single deployment that works on most clusters
- Fast autoscaling, collecting metrics every 15 seconds.
- Resource efficiency, using 1 mili core of CPU and 2 MB of memory for each node in a cluster.
- Scalable support up to 5,000 node clusters.
