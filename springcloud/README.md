The Spring Cloud extensions provide microservice, microservice configuration, and microservice gateway functionality. The microservice registration and configuration functionality is based on the Nacos implementation, and the microservice gateway is based on the Spring Cloud Gateway implementation. If your legacy applications are Nacos compliant, KubeSphere Spring Cloud features can help you gain the operational efficiency of containerized applications while keeping your legacy framework intact.
